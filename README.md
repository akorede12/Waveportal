## Waveportal

This project is a React application that allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet using MetaMask, send personalized messages, and wave to other users. It interacts with a deployed smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to store and retrieve waves containing the sender's address, timestamp, and message. The application provides a user-friendly interface for engaging with the Ethereum network and visualizing the waves sent by various users.

It was developed following instructions from buildspace's build-solidity-web3-app course.
